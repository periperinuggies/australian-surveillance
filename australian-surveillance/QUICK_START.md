- Verify `cameras_database.json` exists and has data

### Can't Login to Admin Panel
- Check credentials in `.env` file
- Verify JWT_SECRET is set
- Clear browser localStorage and try again

### API Connection Error
- Confirm server is running at http://localhost:3000
- Check CORS settings in server.js
- Ensure API_URL in app.js and admin.js points to correct server
